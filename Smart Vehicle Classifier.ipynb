    "### **Description**\n",
    "This project simulates a simple AI-based vehicle classifier using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  \n",
    "It demonstrates:\n",
    "- Inheritance  \n",
    "- Protected and private members  \n",
    "- Method overriding  \n",
    "- Encapsulation  \n",
    "\n",
    "The program manages two types of vehicles: **Car** and **Bike**, both inheriting from a base class **Vehicle**.  \n",
    "A simple classifier method predicts the type of vehicle based on its **speed threshold**.\n",

    "### **Task Statement**\n",
    "Design and implement a simple program that classifies vehicles based on their type and speed using **OOP principles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Requirements**\n",
    "You must:\n",
    "1. Create a base class **Vehicle** that stores vehicle type, name, and speed.  \n",
    "2. Use **protected** and **private** attributes in the base class to demonstrate encapsulation.  \n",
    "3. Implement a method `classify()` that categorizes vehicles as:\n",
    "   - **High-speed Vehicle** → speed > 100  \n",
    "   - **Normal Vehicle** → otherwise  \n",
    "4. Derive two subclasses — **Car** and **Bike** — from **Vehicle**.  \n",
    "   - Each subclass should override the `show_info()` method to display detailed information.  \n",
    "5. Read multiple inputs representing different vehicles, create corresponding objects, and print their details along with their classification results.\n",

    "Bike Added: Yamaha\n",
    "Car Added: Honda\n",
    "\n",
    "--- Vehicle Details ---\n",
    "Type: Car, Name: Toyota, Speed: 150 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "Type: Bike, Name: Yamaha, Speed: 90 km/h, Predicted: Normal Vehicle\n",
    "Type: Car, Name: Honda, Speed: 120 km/h, Predicted: High-speed Vehicle\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Short Hint**\n",
    "- Use a **base class Vehicle** with protected (`_attribute`) and private (`__attribute`) attributes.  \n",
    "- Create **subclasses Car and Bike** that override `show_info()`.  \n",
    "- Implement a simple **speed-based classifier** using the `classify()` method.  \n",
    "- Any speed above **100** is considered a **\"High-speed Vehicle\"**.\n",
